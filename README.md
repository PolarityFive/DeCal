# DeCal
A graphic design assist tool made in C++ and QT. 

A program that perfectly calculates the amount of columns and gutter size for any given width and, if you so wish, margin. 
The algorithm runs on O(1), O(N) and O(n*m) depending on parameterization.
The fron-end was made with QT. 

The program will act a bit wonky if unexpected inputs are given. There is some basic mitigation to avoid crashes but nothing crazy.
